# Stratal-Control-Space-Analysis

Full details of this method are given in Burgess and Steel (2017) here https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3005764/

To run the tool, load the strataSpaceGUI.m file in Matlab, ensuring that the Matlab path includes the folder where you have put both the code and the parameter files, then run the file. You should get a GUI with a series of buttons down the right-hand side of the screen - click on those buttons from top to bottom to go through the analysis workflow, adjusting the filenames in the text boxes above as required. Example input text files defining subsidence, sediment supply and eustasy parameters are included to get you started, all explained in Burgess and Steel (2017).

A key future development for this method and analysis is to develop these input files... contact pmb42@liverpool.ac.uk if you are interested to help do this...
